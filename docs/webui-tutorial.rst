Webui tutorial
##############

In order to quickly give people an overview and idea of what the Raiden Developer Preview is capable of, we have created a simple web application. This application utilizes the :doc:`Raiden REST API endpoints <rest_api>` to allow the user to interact with tokens networks, transfer tokens, see the current status of open channels along with closing and settlings channels to name some of the functionalities. We will get more in depth with the specific things it support in this document. For a more specific guide of the API it self see the :doc:`API Walkthrough <api_walkthrough>`.
